        <h1>Pet Sitting Instructions</h1>
        <h2>Feeding Instructions</h2>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> the dogs eat different kibble because Archie has food allergies. Archie will finish his quickly and try to get Fuji's. Fuji will eat slow and often not finish, so you have to keep an eye on him. If Archie gets Fuji's food it's not a huge deal; we're just trying to keep his weight under control. Archie's scoop is 3/4 cup and metal, Fuji's is the plastic one. Archie gets his food with a lot of water (like soup). Fuji gets a little dash of water because he heaves if his kibble is dry.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fuji AM:</strong> 1/2 Scoop</li>
            <li><strong>Archie AM:</strong> 1 Scoop</li>
            <li><strong>Fuji PM:</strong> 2 Scoops</li>
            <li><strong>Archie PM:</strong> 1 Scoop</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Walking</h2>
        <p>You are welcome to walk them, Fuji will pull a bit but Archie is pretty easy.</p>
        
        <h2>Sleeping</h2>
        <p>They can probably sleep wherever, my mom just put them in the guest room when they stayed at her house. They are not crate trained but are totally fine confined to a room.</p>
